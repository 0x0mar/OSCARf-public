{"name":"OSCARf public","tagline":"Python tool to aid in the collection of OSINT data","body":"OSCAR-F\r\n=======\r\n\r\nPython OSINT Platform\r\n\r\n**WIKI:** https://github.com/NinjaSl0th/OSCARf-public/wiki\r\n\r\n**OSCARf was coded/designed in Linux and Mac. Don't complain if you are running Windows and you cannot get it working**\r\nWindows support is something that I am going to address at a later date.\r\n\r\nOSCAR-F is designed to aid in the process of information gathering. It was formed with the idea of not having to open\r\nso many tabs in a browser.\r\n\r\nThere are a few bugs in OSCAR-F, however, we are slowly working on crushing them and working on features.\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n\r\n**All setup files are located within the setup directory!**\r\n\r\nOSCAR uses a few libraries. These include:\r\n\r\n- Twitter\r\n- tweepy\r\n- feedparser\r\n- shodan\r\n- readline\r\n- pillow\r\n- BeautifulSoup4\r\n- Mechanize\r\n- Requests\r\n\r\nThese can be installed via pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\r\n\r\nIf you receive setup errors similar to:\r\n  `compilation terminated.`\r\n\r\n  `error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1`\r\n  \r\nPlease install the python-dev package: example: `apt-get install python-dev` \r\n\r\n**Please note that you will need to setup ONE twitter app for you/your business.**\r\n\r\n~**You will probably need to use sudo to run the setup script. This is becasue it creates files and directories.**~\r\n\r\nThe the readline feature is completely optional.\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to run the `DEPENDENCY_CHECK` script first! Additionally, as noted above,  dependencies can be installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`\r\n\r\nAfter running the dependency check, run the setup.py script. This will allow you to setup all necessary auth files/data.\r\n**PLEASE NOTE THAT THE SETUP SCRIPT WILL NOT INSTALL MISSING LIBRARIES! Please use pip.**\r\n\r\n## To setup Twitter Application\r\n\r\nNavigate to: https://apps.twitter.com/ and setup a new application. Please note the name and keys associated with it. \r\nYou sould only need to have a read only application!\r\n\r\n## Shodan API KEY\r\n\r\nOnce you have a ShodanHQ account or login, go to: http://www.shodanhq.com/api_doc and copy the API key. Please note that if you want to use ALL of the shodan functionality of OSCAR, you will need to purchase an \"Unlocked API\" \r\n\r\nView API KEY: http://www.shodanhq.com/api_doc\r\n\r\nYou can purchase the \"Unlocked API\" addon here: http://www.shodanhq.com/data/addons\r\n\r\n## To scrape pastebin\r\n\r\nTo scrape pastebin, add regex strings to /config/pSearch.dat located in the root directory. After this, proceed to use oscar.\r\n\r\n## To edit rss filter options\r\n\r\nEdit the keywords in /config/rssfilter.dat\r\n\r\n## To add/remove rss feeds\r\n\r\nEdit rss links in /config/rssfeeds.dat\r\n\r\n## To scrape web source code\r\n\r\nEdit regex info in /config/webscrape.dat in the root. The path will change soon. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
